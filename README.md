# Image Upload Resize 

This sample demonstrates how to respond to an `EventGridEvent` published by a storage account to resize  an image and upload a thumbnail as described in the article [Automate resizing uploaded images using Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-functions%2Ftoc.json&tabs=net).

## Local Setup

Before running this sample locally, you need to add your connection string to the `AzureWebJobsStorage` value in a file named `local.settings.json` file. This file is excluded from the git repository, so an example file named `local.settings.example.json` is provided.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING>",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "THUMBNAIL_CONTAINER_NAME": "thumbnails",
    "THUMBNAIL_WIDTH":  "100",
    "datatype": "binary"
  }
}
```

To use this file, do the following steps:

1. Replace `<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING>` with your storage account connection string
2. Rename the file from `local.settings.example.json` to `local.settings.json`
